# Skēlet.v2
### Skēlet. is a basic HTML5 & CSS3 boilerplate template which gives you the foundations to get started building your next project, easily.

Skēlet. is what you'd do if you started a new project from scratch. 
Except that you don't have to write the initial HTML5 structure, and most importantly you don't have to style from scratch forms, create grids or have to reset the elements or write animations by yourself. Skēlet. helps you skip this initial, and pretty annoying, fase. That's it. If you find it useful make use of it.
